# TODO List

- Perform experiments with integer graph, with integer values the local max cut, should be solvable in P, if the set of values that integers can take is polynomially bounded in the order of the graph
  - this is good comparison for the floating point graph
  - if the possible integer values
- High order testing for graphs
- High repetition testing for graphs
- Test with gnp model
- Test with configuration model
- Polynomial approximation of local max cut (comparison to smooth complexity)
- Test with different graph sizes

- Create Tree Data Structure From Flip Indices

- Split nodes of the graph into two sets, depeding on the sum of the value of all the edges that are connected to the node.
  - First run the algorithm on the set of nodes that have a value larger than epsilon
  - When the improvement is not greater than epsilon, run the algorithm on the set of nodes that have a value smaller than epsilon

- Create violin plot for flip improvements at each step


## Experiments

### Graphs with integer weights

### Pivoting Rules

### Partitioning Rules

### Smoothed Analysis

### Polynomial Approximation to mimic Smoothed Analysis
